# About Shang

## Our Mission

Shang believes in the power of simplicity. We’re building a Web3 tipping platform that fosters authentic social connections with minimal barriers. Starting with Twitter, Shang enables seamless tipping to reward creators, friends, and communities.

## Why It Matters

Tipping isn’t just a transaction—it’s a spark for culture. By reducing complexity and costs, Shang empowers users to share value freely, creating thriving Web3 communities.

- **Frictionless**: Platform-covered gas fees for zero-friction tipping.
- **Affordable**: 0.5% withdrawal fees, 0.1% for instant payments via Stripe.
- **Transparent**: Every tip recorded on-chain for trust and clarity.

## Our Journey
